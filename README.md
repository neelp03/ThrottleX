## **ThrottleX: Scalable Rate Limiting for Go APIs**

Welcome to ThrottleX, a powerful and flexible rate-limiting library for Go! ðŸš€
ThrottleX is designed to provide multiple rate limiting algorithms, easy integration, and scalable storage backends for your APIs.

For complete documentation, examples, and detailed setup instructions, please visit the **[ThrottleX Wiki](https://github.com/neelp03/ThrottleX/wiki)**.

---

## **Features**

- **Multiple Algorithms**:
  - Fixed Window
  - Sliding Window
  - Token Bucket

- **Pluggable Storage Backends**:
  - In-Memory Store
  - Redis Store

- **Thread-Safe and Efficient**:
  - Designed for high concurrency and low latency.
  - Includes mutex cleanup to prevent memory leaks.

- **Highly Configurable**:
  - Customize limits, window sizes, and keys.
  - Support for dynamic configurations.

- **Future Expansion**:
  - Upcoming support for additional rate limiting policies like Leaky Bucket, Concurrency Limit, and more.

---

## **Installation**

To install Throttlex, use `go get`:

```bash
go get -u github.com/neelp03/throttlex
```

For detailed setup instructions, refer to the **[Installation and Setup Wiki Page](https://github.com/neelp03/ThrottleX/wiki/Installation-and-Setup)**.

---

## **Usage**

Import the package into your Go project:

```go
import (
    "github.com/neelp03/throttlex/ratelimiter"
    "github.com/neelp03/throttlex/store"
)
```

For full examples of integrating ThrottleX with REST, gRPC, and GraphQL APIs, please refer to the **[Examples Wiki Page](https://github.com/neelp03/ThrottleX/wiki/ThrottleX-Examples)**.

## **Rate Limiting Algorithms**

ThrottleX currently supports the following rate limiting algorithms:

- **Fixed Window Limiter**
- **Sliding Window Limiter**
- **Token Bucket Limiter**

To learn more about these algorithms and how they work, visit the **[Rate Limiting Algorithms Wiki Page](https://github.com/neelp03/ThrottleX/wiki/Rate-Limiting-Algorithms-in-ThrottleX)**.
