# ThrottleX

**ThrottleX** is a high-performance, distributed rate-limiting solution built with **Go** and **Redis**, designed to manage and control API traffic across multiple instances. It is scalable, fault-tolerant, and optimized for both microservice and public API architectures. ThrottleX supports various rate-limiting policies to ensure system stability under heavy load, and itâ€™s easily deployable using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.

---

## Features (Planned)
- **Distributed Rate Limiting**: Efficiently manage API requests across multiple instances using Redis for distributed coordination.
- **Multiple Policies**: Implement various rate-limiting strategies, such as fixed window, sliding window, and token bucket.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to run in distributed environments with Docker and Kubernetes.
- **API Key Management**: Supports API key-based authentication and user-level rate limiting.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Integration with Datadog, Prometheus, or Grafana for monitoring request traffic and system health.
- **Detailed Logging**: Structured JSON logging with log levels for better debugging and observability.

---

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Go**: Backend implementation.
- **Redis**: For caching and distributed coordination.
- **PostgreSQL**: For API key management (optional).
- **Docker**: For containerization.
- **Kubernetes (Minikube)**: For orchestration and scalability.
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: For real-time monitoring (optional).
- **Logrus**: For leveled JSON logging.

## Installation and Setup (Planned)
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/throttlex.git
   cd throttlex
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure you have Docker and Go installed.
   - Set up Redis and PostgreSQL (if required).
   - Future instructions for environment variables and configurations will be provided.

3. **Build and Run**:
   This section will contain detailed steps on building the application, running it locally, and testing it with Docker and Kubernetes.

---

## Usage (Planned)
ThrottleX will provide a REST API to configure rate limits and monitor API traffic. Example usage and API documentation (with OpenAPI/Swagger) will be added once the initial development is complete.
